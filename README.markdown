# About the Library

This is a development version of a .NET implementation of Stripe's API.

If you're looking for something production-ready, consider https://github.com/criticalaxiom/XamarinStripe, upon which this is based.

Currently, the library supports the charge, refund, customer, subscription APIs, along with some webhook support. It is missing support for plan management and coupons.
